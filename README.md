# Jobless

**Are you and your server players scared of a J\*b?**  
If yes, this is the plugin you've been waiting for.

**Jobless** censors all job-related words like `job`, `resume`, `application`, `hiring`, and more — to keep your Minecraft world free from the existential dread of employment. Ideal for anarchist SMPs, meme servers, or anyone who logs in to *escape* the 9 to 5.
